"Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.",
"This is how it is — this is why you're not in the Order — you don't understand — there are things worth dying for!",
"Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?!",
"Quelli che ci amano non ci lasciano mai veramente.",
"I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for.",
"If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.",
"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us?",
"Well, bad times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others.",
"What's life without a little risk?",
"The world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters."
